These studies led to an interest in the physics of protein crystals, which I focused on in my post-doc. Specifically, I studied the effects of cryo-cooling on the packing within the crystal, and how these effects can be modulated by cryoprotectants. &nbsp; My current research continues in both of these directions. Gory detail follows. If you are interested in the possibility of research or independent study in any of these topics, or anything at the interface of physics and biology, drop me a line. </p><p><u>Long Range Order in Macromolecular Crystals </u></p><p><img src="Crystal-Packing.gif" width="288" height="194"></p><p class="style2">Figure 1. Schematic comparing a salt crystal (left) with a macromolecular crystal (right). The main difference is one of scale. &nbsp; This means that in the macromolecular case the interstices are large and filled with disordered bulk solvent. Also, in the macromolecular case only a small fraction of the atoms are involved in lattice contacts, which make the crystal relatively fragile. &nbsp; When the crystal is cooled, the macromolecules get closer together, shrinking the interstitial space. The bulk solvent must therefore contract the right amount to compensate for the contraction of the interstitial space. The amount of solvent contraction can be adjusted by adding cryoprotectants, which are small molecules such as dimethyl sulfoxide, glucose and glycerol. </p><p>I am interested in developing a more complete physical picture for macromolecular crystals (see Figure 1). &nbsp; Such crystals are used in X-ray diffraction experiments to determine the atomic structures of proteins and nucleic acids. &nbsp; The explosion in such structure determinations in recent years has highlighted the need for a better understanding of these crystals. &nbsp; </p><p>Because macromolecular crystals are relatively fragile and often suffer rapid radiation damage when placed in an X-ray beam, they are usually cooled to ~100 K before diffraction data are collected. &nbsp;&nbsp; Such cooling, however, frequently has deleterious effects on the long-range order in the crystal. &nbsp;&nbsp; Techniques for minimizing, and even reversing this damage have been devised, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. </p><p>My experiments in this area have focused on the role of cryoprotectants in minimizing cooling-induced lattice damage. &nbsp; It appears that cryoprotectants work mainly by adjusting the thermal contraction of the bulk solvent to match the contraction of the interstitial spaces (see Figure 1). &nbsp; These results led to additional experiments to investigate why cooling induced lattice damage can sometimes be recovered by warming the crystal to room temperature and then recooling. This appears to work, at least in part, via the transport of water into or out of the crystal, altering the thermal contraction properties of the bulk solvent to better match the contraction of the interstitial space. </p><p>The thermal contraction of the crystal with cryo-cooling is usually accompanied by lattice repacking. &nbsp; My earlier work suggested that there is a considerable entropic component to such repacking. &nbsp; One long term goal is to study this in more detail computationally by looking the energetics of different packing schemes and simulating transitions between them. &nbsp; </p><p>I also plan to study other aspects of macromolecular crystals. &nbsp; Using visual optics, I plan to look at the effect of humidity and other parameters on crystal size. &nbsp; I have done some initial experiments in this area that show some intriguing anisotropic packing changes as well as an apparently catastrophic crystal degradation. &nbsp; Other possible projects would be obtaining a complete description of the phase diagram for crystallization of  beta-galactosidase, looking for correlations between this phase diagram and the second virial coefficient for interactions between the macromolecules, and looking for scaling relations in nucleation/growth processes as well as quantitatively characterizing non-crystalline results. </p><p><u>The Structure and Function of Macromolecules </u></p><p>Since the 1990s, there has been a huge growth in the determination of three-dimensional structures of proteins and other macromolecules. Figure 2 shows a stylized representation of one such structure. &nbsp; As can be seen in the figure, the structure is quite complex, and includes several different levels of organization (the lowest levels are too small to show in the figure). &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently (2004) there are approximately 20,000 such structures deposited in a national database, some with even more complexity than that shown in Figure 2. </p><p><img src="Betal_Tetramer.gif" width="360" height="269"></p><p><p>Figure 2. Stylized representation of a protein molecule. There are three two-fold axes of symmetry through the center. This molecule is an enzyme called beta-galactosidase and is composed of four identical subunits. The different colors show different domains of each subunit. The active sites (4) are indicated by the pairs of spheres, which indicate the locations of the active site Mg++ and Na+ ions. </p><p></p><br>This wealth of information is readily available and can be used to address all sorts of interesting biophysical questions. &nbsp; To do so, the structures of interest are downloaded, displayed and manipulated with 3D graphics and analyzed by writing programs to carry out calculations on the atomic coordinates. &nbsp; Examples of two such analyses come from my own research. In one case I used the database to gain insight into the evolution of the molecule shown in figure 1 (Juers et al, 1999). In a different case, I used the database to help understand the basic physical question of why protein crystals shrink when they are cooled (see also above; Juers &amp; Matthews, 2001).&nbsp;<p>These structural analyses are now (2004) easily performed with standard desktop personal computers. &nbsp; This is in stark contrast to just a few years ago when expensive workstations were required for this sort of research. A few aspects of my current research will be addressed in this manner. This includes studying the dynamics in a particular interesting catalytic loop of <span class="style1">b</span> -galactosidase and quantifying packing arrangements and densities in protein crystals. </p><p><em></em></p><p><u>The Reaction Mechanism of <em> E. coli </em>Beta-Galactosidase </u></p><p>Another experimental goal is to improve our description of the catalytic mechanism of beta-galactosidase, an enzyme from <em>E. coli. </em>&nbsp; Here the problem being addressed is purely biochemical, but with tools based in physics. &nbsp; Briefly, I used X-ray crystallography to take snapshots of this enzyme along its reaction pathway, which yielded a detailed model for how the enzyme works (Juers, 2000 &amp; Juers et al, 2001). &nbsp; This model, however, raises new questions. &nbsp; </p><p>In particular, we observe a conformational change in the enzyme during its reaction. &nbsp; We also observe both a sodium ion and a magnesium ion in the active site. &nbsp; The roles of these ions and the conformational change are still unclear and I plan to investigate them using site directed mutagenesis in concert with enzyme kinetics, X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simulations. &nbsp; Some of these studies are being done in collaboration with Gene Huber at the University of Calgary. &nbsp; </p><p><u>Studies on the Activity of Single Molecules of Beta- Galactosidase </u></p><p>Recently it has become feasible to study the catalytic activity of single enzyme molecules using fluorescence-based experiments (Xue 1995). &nbsp; Surprisingly, several enzymes show a broad distribution of catalytic efficiencies (up to a 50-fold difference between the least and most active molecules) and the source of this variation in activity is still unclear. I have been collaborating with Doug Craig at University of Winnipeg to look at the effect of crystallization, generally thought to be a selective process, on the activity distribution. &nbsp; We found that crystallization has little effect on the breadth of the distribution although it does affect the mean (Shoemaker et al, 2001). </p><p><u>Student Involvement </u></p><p>Possible specific projects for students include the following: writing image processing software, setting up and experiment to measure density at cryogenic temperatures, writing software to analyze crystal packing schemes, carrying out crystallographic refinements, purifying protein, setting up and monitoring crystallization experiments, and generating variants of various proteins and crystallizing these variants. </p><p><u>Other Areas of Interest </u></p><p> I am interested in all aspects of the confluence of physics and biology. Some of these topics include modeling systems in biology, linguistic and statistical aspects of protein and DNA sequences, allometric scaling, macromolecular motors and other machines, Brownian ratchets, life at the micron scale (inertial versus viscous forces), phantom tones and nonlinearities in hearing, neural networks, flocking, physical models for membranes and DNA and their fluctuations, "new" physics appearing in mesoscopic length regimes, connections between soft condensed matter physics (such as colloid crystal growth) and biological systems and phase transitions in traffic flow. &nbsp; If you are interested in the possibility of research or independent study in any of these topics, or any topic at the interface of physics and biology, drop me a line.</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p><u>References </u></p><p>Garman, E.

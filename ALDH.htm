Russo, Chemistry)</p><p>Human ALDH1A1 is an enzyme important for the formation of retinoic acid. Previous work by Professor Russo and his students has yielded a potent inhibitor of the ALDH1A1 enzyme, 4-(N,N-dipropylamino) benzaldehyde (DPAB).&nbsp;We are attempting to crystallize a ternary complex between this enzyme, its NADH cofactor and DPAB. This is of interest because to date, structures of ALDH enzymes have been reported with only cofactor bound, but not inhibitor.</p></body></html>

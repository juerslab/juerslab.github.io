Macromolecular crystals suffer damage from ionizing radiation. This is
especially problematic at the high intensity X-ray sources at 3rd
generation synchrotrons. The problem of radiation damage in
macromolecular crystallography has been studied quite extensively with
focus on low temperature (100K and below). However, recently attention
has moved to high temperatures. This interest has been spurred in part
by the development of very fast detectors, which are opening the
possibility of collecting X-ray data at synchrotrons at ~room
temperature before radiation damage has had a chance to set in. <br>

<br>

We looked at the temperature dependence of radiation damage to crystals
of thermolysin (at 100K vs 160K), and tried to understand the results
in terms of the relationship between protein atoms and their proximity
to solvent channels. The take home message can be summarized in the
following figures from our paper: <a href="papers/P2011_TLNRD_JSR.pdf">Juers,

Hotspots - the atoms most affected by radiation exposure (as measured
by relative change in atom B-factor). Left - 100K and Right - 160 K. At
the higher temperature the hotspots are more concentrated near the
surface of the protein, while at 100 K the hotspots are distributed
relatively uniformly throughout the molecule <br>

<div style="width: 600px; height: 384px; float: right;">Dependence of
radiation susceptibility on residue depth (or distance to nearest
solvent channel)
as measured with <a href="Channel_Mapping.shtml">map_channels</a>. <br>
<br>
The top graph shows that at 100 K, there is not a strong correlation
between the susceptibility and the residue depth. <br>
<br>
The bottom graph, at 160 K, shows a stronger correlation.<br>
<br>
This implies "protection" from the effects of radiation for residues
further from solvent channels at 160 K but not at 100 K. <br>

</small></h1>

<p>Crystal mounting for macromolecular crystallography typically
involves exposing the crystals to ambient conditions for some period of
time during looping. Our cryo-optimization experiments were difficult
to interpret due to variation from dehydration during mounting. To
combat these dehydration issues, we invented a new approach to crystal
mounting, "vial mounting", which reduces variation from dehydration.
Crystals are mounted directly on the cold stream from a vial in which
the crystal is in vapor equilibrium with its cryosolution. A paper on
this topic is here:</p>

We also found that vial mounting can be used to cryoprotect crystals
using vapor diffusion to deliver volatile cryoprotective agents to the
crystals - no liquid soaking required!<br>

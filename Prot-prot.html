Interactions especially for Protein Crystallization<br>

<p>Methylamine Osmolytes in Protein Crystallography</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Osmolytes are organic solutes made by
marine organisms for maintaining osmotic balance in saline
environments. At Whitman, Biologist <a href="http://www.whitman.edu/%7Eyancey/">Paul Yancey </a>investigates
the constallation of osmlytes used by various marine organisms as a
function of habitat (e.g. high vs low pressure). Osmolytes modulate
both protein stability and solubility, and one osmolyte in particular,
TMAO (trimethylamine N-oxide), is well-known for upstabilizing
proteins. We are studying TMAO and other methylamine osmolytes as tools
for crystallization and cryoprotection. We have found TMAO
(trimethylamine N-oxide) <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22194335">TMAO
(trimethylamine N-oxide to be an effective primary precipitant for protein crystallization.</a> As well, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/%20doi:10.1107/S0021889811000045">TMAO</a>, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22194335">sarcosine, and betaine </a>are all effective cryoprotective agents for cryocrystallography. <br>

<p>PEG Induced Crystallization<br>
</p>


<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a well-known
polymer that sees multiple
uses, including in the growth of macromolecular crystals. PEG induced
macromolecular crystallization is thought to function via an entropic
mechanism called the depletion effect. Here the PEG molecules, which
are somewhat smaller than the protein molecules, are excluded from the
protein surface because of their finite size. If the protein molecules
associate, then the volume of solution accessible to the PEG actually
increases, which is entropically favorable. If enough PEG molecules are
in the solution, then this can actually drive the protein molecules
together into a crystal. Recent solution studies looking at a
liquid-liquid phase transition have suggested that small molecular
weight PEGs may instead produce an effective repulsion between protein
molecules. We are investigating whether this is true for protein
crystallization.</p>

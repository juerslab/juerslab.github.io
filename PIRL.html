<p class="style1" align="center">PIRL (Plant Intracellular Ras-group
related LRR) </p>

<p class="style2">PIRLs are plant genes discovered by <a href="http://people.whitman.edu/%7Evernondm/">Dan Vernon and coworkers</a>
that represent a heretofore undescribed family of plant LRR (leucine
rich repeat) proteins. The PIRL proteins are more closely related to
Ras-group <strong>animal</strong> LRR proteins than any plan proteins.
LRR motifs often function as scaffolds to mediate protein-protein
interactions. </p>

<p class="style2">We are working to determine the three-dimensional
structure of PIRL proteins, which has the following potential benefits:</p>

<p class="style2">1. Direct structural comparison to better-described
animal LRR proteins may improve our functional understanding of the
PIRLS.</p>

<p class="style2">2. Domain structure may provide functional
information, in particular whether the N-terminal region of the the
PIRLs function themselves as mediators of protein-protein interactions.</p>

<p class="style2">Database searches suggest the following for PIRL1
domain organization:</p>

<p class="style1"><img style="width: 600px; height: 71px;" alt="PIRL1 Domain Organization" src="images/PIRL1_small.jpg"> </p>

<p>CT = predicted chloroplast targeting sequence</p>

<p>CC = predicted coiled-coil region</p>

<p>Ncap = putative N-cap for LRR domain</p>

<p>LRR = leucine-rich repeat</p>

<p>C-term = the remainder of the protein</p>

<p>We have tried to express and purify several different combinations
of these various parts. Generally the proteins express very well in <em>E.
coli</em>, but are insoluble. They can be refolded into soluble
protein, but this is aggregated into a large megacomplex of &gt; 10
subunits.&nbsp; </p>

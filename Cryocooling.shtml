<p class="style2">Because macromolecular crystals are sensitive to X-rays, so they are
usually cryogenically cooled to ~100K prior to X-ray exposure. This
slows the X-ray damage processes.</p>


<p class="style2">BUT, the cooling process itself can damage the
crystal. We are trying to understand this cooling damage with the aim
of improving cooling techniques. We are interested in the following
related questions:</p>


<ol class="style2">
<li>What is the nature of cooling damage to crystals? </li><li>How do cryoprotectants work to limit cooling damage?</li><li>Can cooling damage be reversed in a predictable way based on the
nature of the damage?</li><li>How much information about a particular macromolecular crystal is
required to choose a good cryoprotectant?</li>
</ol>


<p class="style2">Our work and others' have suggested the following
mechanism for cryoprotectant action. It appears that cryoprotectants
work in part by adjusting the thermal contraction of the bulk solvent
to match the contraction of the interstitial spaces. Our papers on this topic:</p>

<p class="style2">These results led to additional experiments to
investigate why cooling induced lattice damage can sometimes be
recovered by warming the crystal to room temperature and then
recooling. This appears to work, at least in part, via the transport of
water into or out of the crystal, altering the thermal contraction
properties of the bulk solvent to better match the contraction of the
interstitial space. This paper is here:</p>

  </li>
</ul>



<p>We are continuing this work by carrying out X-ray diffraction
experiments on
various protein crystals in concert with bulk measurements on the
thermal contraction of solutions of water and various cryoprotective
agents.</p>

<p class="style1" align="center">Myelin Basic Protein &#8211; An
Intrinsically Unstructured Multiple Sclerosis Auto-Antigen</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease with
autoimmune characteristics. The primary auto-antigen in MS is myelin
basic protein (MBP), a major component of the myelin sheath that
encases axons. We are interested in the structure of MBP, as this may
shed light on the etiology of MS. Additionally, MBP is an intrinsically
unstructured protein (ISP), meaning it lacks tertiary structure in the
absence of its interaction partners.&nbsp; Improved methods for probing
the structures of ISPs are needed, as more are more ISPs are being
discovered.&nbsp; </p>

<p>MBP removed from its native environment of myelin lacks structure,
but gains structure in the presence of lipids. Additionally, MBP is
known to interact with several other proteins, including calmodulin,
actin, tubulin and clathrin. In order to crystallize MBP, we plan to
work with MBP in the presence of its interaction partners rather than
in solution by itself. Additionally, we are working with fusion
proteins between MBP and its interaction partners actin and calmodulin.
Our hope is that with the combination of the presence of structure
inducing lipids, the interaction partner actin (or calmodulin) and a
built in linker between the two proteins that crystallization will be
favorable. </p>

<p class="style2">Figure 1. Schematic showing the fusion protein
between myelin basic protein (MBP) and actin, connected by a 5 amino
acid linker. MBP is thought to form a 'C' shape based on electron
microscopy. The high resolution crystal structure of actin is known.

<p class="style2">Figure 2. Schematic outlying the idea behind our
crystallization strategy. We hope to use the native MBP-actin
interaction (shown by +++/ ----) to help grow the crystal. The
experiment will be carried out in the presence of lipids, which will
probably be required for MBP to adopt a native folded structure.

<p class="style3">Thus far we have attempted to produce fusion proteins
between MBP and calmodulin and MBP and actin. The MBP-calmodulin fusion
proteins did not express in <em>E. coli</em>, but the MBP-actin fusion
protein expresses fairly well. We are now working to purify this fusion
protein and then attempt the crystallizations outlined above. </p>
